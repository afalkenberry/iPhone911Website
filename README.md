New website I'm building from scratch

Replacing the website created in 2018 for the company TheiPhone911 that I've worked for seasonally the past couple years. Modernizing the site utilizing the bootstrap framework along with adding custom CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, PHP, and a database/ form to easily update pricing on the site.
